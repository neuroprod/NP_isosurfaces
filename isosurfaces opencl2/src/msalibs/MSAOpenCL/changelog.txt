ofxOpenCL changelog

v2.0
--------------------
- move to centralized MSALibs (requires MSACore)
- everything is MSA:: namespace


--------------------------- move to centralized MSALibs for cross openFrameworks / Cinder compatibility ---------------------------


v0.3
--------------------
- added image support
- restructured buffer/memory management
- minor break in backwards compatability: createBuffer returns ofxOpenCLBuffer instead of cl_mem. so
   - writeBuffer and readBuffer are methods of ofxOpenCLBuffer, not ofxOpenCL
   - when passing buffer (or image) as parameter to ofxOpenCLKernel::setArg, use ofxOpenCLBuffer::getMemoryObject() (which returns the cl_mem)
   


v0.2
--------------------
- added support for multiple devices
- sharing context with opengl (only on mac osx at the moment)
- better handling of multi-dimensional data (minor backwards compatability break with kernel::run)
- support for opengl/opencl buffer+texture sharing 
- can load programs from binary (support for creating binary coming soon)


v0.1
--------------------
- initial version
